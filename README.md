## Core Concept

The hardest part of starting a new venture is finding a validated problem to solve. InfoKing automates this discovery process by using Google's Gemini AI to scan real-time conversations on platforms like Reddit, X (Twitter), YouTube, and TikTok. It identifies genuine user pain points and brainstorms innovative app-based solutions, giving you a head start in building the next big thing.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash` for text, `imagen-3.0-generate-002` for images)
-   **PDF Generation**: jsPDF
-   **Offline Storage**: Browser localStorage (simulating a Supabase backend)
-   **Bundler/Dev Environment**: Assumes Vite or similar modern setup.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need a local development environment that can handle React, TypeScript, and module imports.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser.
-   A local web server (like the `Live Server` extension for VS Code, or a project setup with Vite/Create React App).
-   A Google Gemini API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Setup

1.  **Download the project files.**

2.  **Set up the API Key:** The application is configured to use an environment variable for the Google Gemini API key. How you set this depends on your development setup:
    -   If using **Vite**, create a `.env` file in the project root and add:
        ```
        VITE_GEMINI_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    -   If using another tool, ensure the variable `import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_KEY` is correctly populated with your API key. The file `src/services/geminiService.ts` expects this variable.

3.  **Serve the `index.html` file** from your local web server. The app should load and be ready to use.

## How to Use InfoKing

1.  **Discover**: Use the "Find New Ideas" button, specify a topic, or use the voice assistant to generate new app ideas.
2.  **Analyze**: Click "Brainstorm" on any idea card to get a detailed AI analysis.
3.  **Visualize**: Click "Mockup" to see a basic wireframe of the app.
4.  **Build**: Click "Build App" to get starter code or prompts for other AI tools.
5.  **Pitch**: Click "Pitch Deck" to create a downloadable PDF presentation.
