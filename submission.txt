**InfoKing: Billion-Dollar Idea Goldmine**
**Inspiration**: Inspired by the need to uncover real user problems from social platforms (X, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok), InfoKing uses AI to scrape and rank billion-user app ideas for health, productivity, and finance, empowering entrepreneurs.
**Tech**: Built with React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (Postgres, real-time), Gemini 2.5 Pro for scraping. Hosted on Netlify. Features gamified UI (confetti, progress bars), offline storage, privacy-first.
**Lessons**: Overcame environment variable issues with Vite, simplified deployment with Netlify, learned AIâ€™s power for market gap analysis.
